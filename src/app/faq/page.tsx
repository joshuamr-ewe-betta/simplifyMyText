          question="What is the brevity score?"
          answer="The score is calculated according to how many characters are removed, without removing important content or significantly changing the tone. If it removes less than 10% of text, score = 10. 20-29% reduction = 8. 40-49% = 6. 60-69%= 4, and so on. You should aim for a score of 9-10."
